# Katalon: Getting Started Creating Tests

## Adding a New Test Case

Once the project is open in Katalon there will be an information pane on the left hand side. Right clicking the "Test Cases" folder and clicking "New -> Test Case" will create a new test case:

After giving the test case a name, the template for creating a test will look blank like the following image:

## Recording Test Steps

To start recording steps for a new test, click the "Record Web" button:

It will let you choose the starting URL of the test as well as the browser to record tests in:

Once these options are configured click "Record":

After completing all of your test steps click on "Save Script" and then click "Ok" if another window pops up:

This will close the browser and convert all of your steps into a test as seen below:

The columns of the test are as follows:

- First Column = Command Name
- Second Column = The object the command is operating on
- Third Column = Input to the Command and or Object

These are the basics for creating a test in Katalon Studio. For more advanced test creation/editing please see the other tutorials.
